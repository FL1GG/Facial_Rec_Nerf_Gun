# Facial_Rec_Nerf_Gun
Applied facial recognition to a Nerf Gun and then coded the camera and motors of the Nerf Gun to track and shoot faces. The Project operates off a two axis system. One motor controls the X axis and the other the Y axis. A camera is attached to the front of gun and this is how it aligns itself. It also uses a servo for the trigger. NOTE this has the unintended consquence of pulling the trigger every time it starts up as the servo tests its range.
